ABLATE is a [UB CHREST](https://www.buffalo.edu/chrest.html) project focused on leveraging advances in both exascale computing and machine learning to better understand the turbulent mixing and fuel entrainment in the combustion environment that is critical to the operation of hybrid rocket motors. Documentation can be found at [ABLATE Documentation](https://ablate.dev) along with a [Getting Started Guide](http://ablate.dev/content/GettingStarted.html)
