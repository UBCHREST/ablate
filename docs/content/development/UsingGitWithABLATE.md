## Git Introduction

Version control is a fundamental aspect of successful software development regardless of the target product or development team.  ABLATE is using Git for version control hosted on [Github.com](https://github.com/UBCHREST/ablate).  Git and the associated workflows define how people develop, document, test, and contribute code to the project.  If you are new to Git or unsure/unconvinced why we are using version control it is recommend that you watch the [Git Introduction by Alicia Klinvex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dkvuC8MzPI) presented at Argonne Training Program on Extreme-Scale Computing 2017.  The following guide provides quick reference to some of the common Git workflows as applied to ABLATE.

## Forking ABLATE
If you plan on making any contributions to ABLATE you must first fork ABLATE.  This creates a version of ABLATE that you can modify, commit, and test. When complete, you can create a Pull Request to bring your changes back to the main branch. [GitHub Forking Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) provides a very detailed summary of creating and using forks.

> "A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project." - GitHub

1. **Sign Into GitHub**  If you do not already have a GitHub account, you will need to [create](https://github.com/join) a GitHub account to fork and contribute to ABLATE.  
1. **Navigate to ABLATE Repo** Navigate to the ablate repo at https://github.com/UBCHREST/ablate.
1. **Fork the Repo**  Press the "Fork" button in the upper-right-hand corner of the page and follow the on-screen directions to create your own fork.

1. **Get your Fork Url** You now have a fork of the ABLATE repository.  You can make changes and try new things without concern of breaking ABLATE.  You can tell when you are in your fork by looking at the upper left-hand corner where it should say YOURUSERNAME/ablate.  You will need your fork git url in future steps.  This can be found by clicking the Code button.

## Working with Git
Git allows you to easily collaborate between people, back-up your code, and keep track of your changes. It is recommend that you make your code changes on a branch within your fork. The "feature" branch is usually a single set of changes to accomplish one feature or fix a bug.  The following steps use the command line but can often be performed using your IDE (i.e. [Clion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/), [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)) or a stand alone app (i.e.[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)).

1. **Creating a Branch** Before working on new code you should create a feature branch.  You probably want to [update your fork](#updating-your-fork) before branching.  Common convection is to name your branch after the feature/bug you are addressing (e.g. USERNAME/FEATURE-BUG, mmcgurn/faster-algorithm)
   ```bash
   # From inside your repository create a branch using the following naming template
   git branch -b USERNAME/FEATURE-BUG
   ```
2. **Committing your Code** Because you are on your own branch/fork you can and should commit your code often.
   ```bash
   # Get a list of changes to your code
   git status
   
   # Stage the changes.  To add all files
   git add -A

   # or a specific file
   gid add path/to/file
   
   # Commit the staged changes
   git commit -m "detailed message about changes"
   ```
3. **Push your Changes**  Everything done thus far has been only on your local machine.  Once your commit is pushed to origin you can continue your work on other machines, test your code on a cluster, or start a pull request.
   ```bash
   # Commit your code as outlined in the previous step
   
   # Push to origin
   git push
   
   # If this is the first time pushing a branch you get an error like "fatal: The current branch mcgurn/doc-getting-started has no upstream branch." Follow the on screen instructions to set the remote information and push. 
   ```

## Contributing Code (aka Pull Request)
It is highly recommend that you merge your changes back into ABLATE often.  This is done using a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), which asks the team to review and "pull" your changes back into ABLATE from your fork/branch. 
1. Start on your feature branch outlined in [Working with Git](#working-with-git) with any changes that you would like to share.
1. Update any documentation within the docs folder.
1. Update and create any needed tests.  The [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) framework is used to control and monitor tests.
1. Make sure that all code meets formatting requirements [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) for c++ and [PETSc Style and Usage Guide](https://docs.petsc.org/en/latest/developers/style/) for C.
    ```bash
    # To run a format check from build directory
    make format-check
    ```
1. Update the ABLATE version in the CMakeLists.txt file in the root of the project following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
1. Follow the [Working with Git](#working-with-git) steps to commit and push any additional changes.
1. Navigate to your fork of ABLATE on GitHub.com.
1. If presented with the button to "Compare & pull request" you can select this.  Otherwise, select the "Pull requests" tab and select the "New pull request" button.
   ![github start pr](assets/github_start_pr.png)
1. Configure and create your pull request
   1. Check the source and destination repositories.  The source repository should be your feature branch on your fork.  The destination repository should be UBCHREST/ablate main.
   1. Add a title and detailed description.  Within the description you should link/close any related issues.
   1. Assign any reviewer that you would like to review the pr.
   1. Create the pull request
   ![github configuring pr issue](assets/github_issue_pr.png)
1. Squash and Merge your pull request once all of the tests have run/pass and your code changes are reviewed.  If the tests fail or if changes are requested you can simply make changes to your local branch and push.  The PR will be automatically updated and the tests re-run.
1. Once your code changes have been merged, you will want to [update your fork](#updating-your-fork).

## Updating your Fork
Before you can do complete a Pull Request or if you need a newer version of ABLATE you will need to update your fork with the changes to ABLATE.  [GitHub Syncing](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#step-3-configure-git-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-spoon-knife-repository) provides detailed direction for updating your repository. A summary specific to ABLATE is provided here.

1. **Access your Git Fork** If you have been using your repository it probably has been locally cloned.
2. **Add Upstream URL** You need to tell git to check the ABLATE repository for changes.  This is done by setting the Git repository as upstream.  This only needs to be done once.
   ```bash
   # Navigate into your local fork repository
   
   # List the remote urls
   git remote -v
   
   # If upstream is not listed, add it with the following command
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/UBCHREST/ablate.git
   ```
2. **Fetch and Merge Changes** Fetch the changes from the upstream main ABLATE branch.
   ```bash
   # Fetch the changes in ABLATE
   git fetch upstream
   
   # Check out your fork's local default branch
   git checkout main
   
   # Merge the changes from the upstream default branch
   git merge upstream/main
   ```
