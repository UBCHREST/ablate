There are two main ways to install the required dependencies for ABLATE locally (directly or with docker).  Installing directly may result in more control of the dependencies and increased computational speed.  Using docker/CLion may allow you to get started faster.  If using docker/CLion skip to [Downloading and Building with CLion (with docker dependencies)]({{ site.baseurl}}{%link content/development/BuildingAblateLocally.md  %}#downloading-and-building-with-clion-with-docker-dependencies)

Keeping all dependency build steps updated can be difficult as they change often and are OS/platform specific. To allow the most up-to-date information to be avaiable dependcy build steps are maintained in the [ABLATE wiki](https://github.com/UBCHREST/ablate/wiki).  Please follow the step-by-step guides for your OS/platform on the ABLATE wiki to install the required dependencies.
