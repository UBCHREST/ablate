# ### Description
# A radiation solver verification case using parallel plates and an absorbing media with black body bounding surfaces.
# This is a 2-dimensional case using a 3x20 plane of cells in order to predict a quasi-1D solution.
# The temperature field of the media between the plates is prescribed as an asymmetrical piecewise parabola.
#
# ### Parameters
# The tunable parameter of this problem is the absorptivity ($$\kappa$$), which controls how much radiation
# is attenuated or emitted by the absorbing media based on its temperature excess relative to black body.
#
# | parameters | formula | value |
# |:----------|:---------|:------|
# | $$\kappa$$ | $$\frac{d I}{d x} = \kappa (\frac{\sigma T^4}{\pi} - I)$$ | 1.0  |
#
# ### Fields
# The temperature field in this problem is assigned explicitly as an input. Based on this temperature field and
# the absorptivity of the medium, the analytical solution for the net radiation heat transfer can be calculated
# through a numerical integration.
# if $$y < 0$$
# $$T = -6.349E6 y^2 + 2000.0 [K]$$
# if $$y > 0$$
# $$-1.179E7 y^2 + 2000.0 [K]$$
