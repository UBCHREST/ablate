#### Description
#A radiation solver verification case using parallel plates and an absorbing media with black body bounding surfaces.
#This is a 2-dimensional case using a 3x20 plane of cells in order to predict a quasi-1D solution.
#The temperature field of the media between the plates is prescribed as an asymmetrical piecewise parabola.
#
#### Parameters
#The tunable parameter of this problem is the absorptivity ($$\kappa$$), which controls how much radiation
#is attenuated or emitted by the absorbing media based on its temperature excess relative to black body.
#
#| parameters | formula | value |
#|:----------|:---------|:------|
#| $$\kappa$$ | $$\frac{d I}{d x} = \kappa (\frac{\sigma T^4}{\pi} - I)$$ | 1.0  |
#
#### Fields
#The temperature field in this problem is assigned explicitly as an input. Based on this temperature field and
#the absorptivity of the medium, the analytical solution for the net radiation heat transfer can be calculated
#through a numerical integration.
#if $$y < 0$$
#$$T = -6.349E6 y^2 + 2000.0 [K]$$
#if $$y > 0$$
#$$-1.179E7 y^2 + 2000.0 [K]$$
