# This is an example and tutorial of setting up a 2D gmsh input file for compressible flow with LODI extruded boundaries.  The tutorial provides guidance/examples on creating the gmsh mesh using the GUI.
#
#   ## Geometry
#   1. Install [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info) and open a new document
#   2. Define the outline of the pipe using a series of points under 'Modules > Geometry > Elementary entities > Add > Point#
#
# - 0.0, 0.0, 0.0
# - 0.5, 0.0, 0.0
# - 0.5, .1, 0.0
# - 0.0, .1, 0.0
#
#   3. Connect the points using 'Modules > Geometry > Elementary entities > Add > Line'
#   ![gMesh Line Connect Step](assets/gMshLineConnect.png)
#
#   4. Define a new surface using 'Modules > Geometry > Elementary entities > Add > Plane surface'
#   ![gMesh Plane Surface Connect Step](assets/gMshPlaneSurface.png)
#
#   5. Define the boundary conditions using physical groups.  Define the left boundary as 'inlet' using 'Modules > Geometry > Physical groups > Add > Curve'.  Repeat for the 'wall' (top/bottom) and 'outlet' (right hand side).
#
#   6. Define the 'main' mesh using a physical group.  Define the surface as 'main' using 'Modules > Geometry > Physical groups > Add > Surface'.
#
#   ## Meshing
#   1. Configure Gmsh to produce hexes/quads using the following settings in 'Tools > Options > Mesh > General Tab'
#   | setting  | value |
#   |:-----------|:------|
#   | 2D algorithm |  Frontal-Delaunay for Quads (experimental)  |
#   | 3D algorithm        |  Delaunay |
#   | 2D recombination algorithm        |  Blossom Full-Quad |
#   | Recombine all triangular meshes     |  'check' |
#   | Subdivision algorithm | All Quads |
#   | Min/Max element size | Reasonable values for mesh |
#
#   ![gMesh Hex Options](assets/gMshHexOptions.png)
#   2. Generate the mesh
#   1. Generate the line mesh 'Modules > Mesh > 1D'
#   2. Generate the surface mesh 'Modules > Mesh > 2D'
#   3. If creating a 3D mesh, 'Modules > Mesh > 3D'
#   4. If a higher resolution mesh is needed, adjust the settings in Step 1 or select 'Modules > Mesh > Refine by splitting'
#
#   3. Output the mesh.  'File > Save Mesh' should produce a *.msh file with the same name as the geometry.  The [pipeFlow.geo](pipeFlow.geo) [pipeFlow.msh](pipeFlow.msh) files used in this example are provided to download.
