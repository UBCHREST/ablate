# This is an example of a well documented regression or integration test with linked files and images.
# Anything before the first set of ___ will be treated as part of the ablate.dev website documentation (with the first # removed.
# Everything after the first # in this section will be treated as markdown allowing for
# ## Equations
# $$a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0$$
#
# ## Images
# Images should be placed locally and specified as a relative file path (node the ! for images).  This can be but doesn't have to be in subdirectories.
#
# ![example regression rate image](exampleImage.png)
#
# ## Linked files
# [Linked files](assets/exampleFile.txt) work in a way that is similar to the images but without the !. This can be but doesn't have to be in subdirectories.
#
# ## Tables
#
# | parameters  | value |
# |:-----------|:------|
# | a    |  101  |
# | b         |  102 |
