# This is an example of setting up a 2D SlabBurner Simulation using the gMsh python api with a series of derived slab burner points.
### Mesh Generation Script
#
#1. Open the [slabBurner3DMeshGen.py](slabBurner3DMeshGen.py) python
#2. Update the geometry if necessary
#3. To preview the resulting mesh run with the ```--preview``` argument
#4. Generate the [slabBurner3DMesh.msh](slabBurner3DMesh.msh) mesh file by running without the preview argument.
